Thanks for being part of the RDO community!

Thanks to those that were paying attention, and missed the May
newsletter. I was traveling for 3 weeks in May, and the newsletter
slipped through the cracks.

As always I love hearing your feedback about the newsletter, as well as
your input into what content we need to add to it. Thanks!

## Contributor Survey

A few months ago, we conducted a survey of RDO developers to discover
what we can do better, and what we should do differently, to improve the
developer experience around RDO. Hopefully this, in turn, will also
improve the user experience.

Last week we published the results of that survey. With 21 RDO
developers responding, we got a pretty consistent message that the best
thing we can do is improve the documentation, so that it's less of a
barrier to new contributors. You can read the survey results on the [RDO
blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2017/05/rdo-contributor-survey/)
and you can see the detailed feedback on the [RDO mailing
list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2017-May/msg00051.html)

We'll also be running an RDO Documentation Sprint Day in the coming
weeks. See the 'Upcoming Events' section below for more details.

## Community meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.
