Thanks for being part of the RDO community!

Thanks to those that were paying attention, and missed the May
newsletter. I was traveling for 3 weeks in May, and the newsletter
slipped through the cracks.

As always I love hearing your feedback about the newsletter, as well as
your input into what content we need to add to it. Thanks!

## Contributor Survey

A few months ago, we conducted a survey of RDO developers to discover
what we can do better, and what we should do differently, to improve the
developer experience around RDO. Hopefully this, in turn, will also
improve the user experience.

Last week we published the results of that survey. With 21 RDO
developers responding, we got a pretty consistent message that the best
thing we can do is improve the documentation, so that it's less of a
barrier to new contributors. You can read the survey results on the [RDO
blog](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2017/05/rdo-contributor-survey/)
and you can see the detailed feedback on the [RDO mailing
list](https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2017-May/msg00051.html)

To this end, we'll be running an RDO Documentation Sprint Day in the coming
weeks. See the 'Upcoming Events' section below for more details.

See also the [RDO User Survey
results](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/11/how-are-you-using-rdo/)
from last last year.

## Recent Events

In May, there were two big events for RDO. 

The first week of May we had a booth at Red Hat Summit in Boston, where
we showcased the RDO minicluster, running RDO Newton on 4 Intel NUC
machines. (There will be a longer writeup of this cluster on the [RDO
blog](http://rdoproject.org/blog/) next week!)  We also shared space
with the ManageIQ project, who connected their NUC cluster to ours, and
managed our RDO cloud from their control panel. We also had a lot of
great conversations with users of RDO.

The following week, we were back in Boston for OpenStack Summit, this
time at the Hynes convention center. RDO shared space with Red Hat at
the headline sponsor booth, where we had many more great conversations
with RDO users, and once again demo'ed our minicluster. And, of course,
as at every OpenStack Summit, we had
[ducks](https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2015/10/ducks/).

On Wednesday evening, we had a gathering of RDO users and developers,
with about 60 in attendance, to celebrate the community, and thank you
for being part of the RDO effort. Thanks to all who attended. (You can
see some photos of the event on

## Community meetings 

Every Wednesday at 15:00 UTC, we have the weekly RDO community meeting on the #RDO channel on Freenode IRC. The agenda for this meeting is posted each week in a [public etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Meeting) and the minutes from the meeting are posted [on the RDO website](https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/). If there's something you'd like to see happen in RDO - a package that is missing, a tool that you'd like to see included, or a change in how things are governed - this is the best time and place to help make that happen.
